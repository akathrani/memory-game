# Memory Game - Diamond Sweeper

There are 8 diamonds hidden on the board, each diamond behind one of the squares.
The game ends when all diamonds are found. The user's score is the number of squares still left unturned.

<ul>
	<li>Make sure you have a recent version of <code>Node.js</code> installed.</li>
	<li>Create React App to make a new project:</li>
	<li>Delete all files in the src/ folder of the new project.</li>

```bash
	npx create-react-app diamond-sweeper
```
```bash
	cd diamond-sweeper
	cd src

	# If you're using a Mac or Linux:
	rm -f *

	# Or, if you're on Windows:
	del *

	# Then, switch back to the project folder
	cd ..
```	
<li>And copy folders src, public from memory-game-master</li>

Now if you run <code>npm start</code> in the project folder and open <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in the browser, you should see Diamond Sweeper.
